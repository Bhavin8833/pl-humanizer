    "text": "So, I was trying to fix my old laptop yesterday, and honestly, it was a nightmare. I thought it would be a simple RAM upgrade, you know, pop the back open, slide the stick in, and boom—faster computer. But no. Nothing is ever that simple for me.\r\n\r\nFirst off, I stripped a screw. Of course I did. I didn't have the right screwdriver size, but I was too lazy to go to the garage to get the kit, so I used a kitchen knife. Bad idea. I spent like twenty minutes trying to twist this tiny screw out with pliers, sweating profusely.\r\n\r\nWhen I finally got it open, the inside was caked in dust. I'm talking years of dust bunnies just living rent-free on my motherboard. I grabbed a can of compressed air and went to town. PRO TIP: Don't hold the can upside down using it. I froze my hand and sprayed liquid all over the fan. I nearly had a heart attack thinking I fried the thing.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I eventually got the RAM in, closed it up (minus one screw, RIP), and hit the power button. Black screen. Nothing. My heart sank. I was ready to throw the thing out the window. I sat there for five minutes just staring at my reflection in the black screen, questioning my life choices.\r\n\r\nThen I realized I hadn't plugged the battery back in.\r\n\r\nPlugged it in. It booted. It flies now. But man, the stress wasn't worth it. Next time I'm just paying someone to do it. Or buying a mac.\r\n",

    "text": "[Content from Paul Graham's 'Do Things that Don't Scale']\r\nOne of the most common types of advice we give at Y Combinator is to do things that don't scale. A lot of would-be founders believe that startups either take off or don't. You build something, make it available, and if you've made a better mousetrap, people beat a path to your door as promised. Or they don't, in which case the market must not exist. Actually startups take off because the founders make them take off. There may be a handful that just grew by themselves, but usually it takes some sort of push to get them going. A good metaphor would be the cranks that car engines had before they got electric starters. Once the engine was going, it would keep going, but there was a separate and laborious process to get it going.\r\n\r\nThe most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the start is to recruit users manually. Nearly all startups have to. You can't wait for users to come to you. You have to go out and get them. Stripe is one of the most successful startups we've funded, and the problem they solved was an urgent one. If anyone could have sat back and waited for users, it was Stripe. But in fact they're famous within YC for aggressive early user acquisition.\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons founders resist going out and recruiting users individually. One is a combination of shyness and laziness. They'd rather sit at home writing code than go out and talk to a bunch of strangers and probably be rejected by most of them. But for a startup to succeed, at least one founder (usually the CEO) will have to spend a lot of time on sales and marketing. The other reason founders ignore this path is that the absolute numbers seem so small at first. This can't be how the big, famous startups got started, they think. The mistake they make is to underestimate the power of compound growth.\r\n\r\nAirbnb is a classic example of this technique. Marketplaces are so hard to get rolling that you should expect to take heroic measures at first. In Airbnb's case, these consisted of going door to door in New York, recruiting new users and helping existing ones improve their listings. When I remember the Airbnbs during YC, I picture them with rolly bags, because when they showed up for tuesday dinners they'd always just flown back from somewhere.\r\n\r\nI have never once seen a startup lured down a blind alley by trying too hard to make their initial users happy. But perhaps the biggest thing preventing founders from realizing how attentive they could be to their users is that they've never experienced such attention themselves. Their standards for customer service have been set by the companies they've been customers of, which are mostly big ones. Tim Cook doesn't send you a hand-written note after you buy a laptop. He can't. But you can. That's one advantage of being small: you can provide a level of service no big company can.\r\n",

    "text": "[Content from Paul Graham's 'Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule']\r\nOne reason programmers dislike meetings so much is that they're on a different type of schedule from other people. Meetings cost them more. There are two types of schedule, which I'll call the manager's schedule and the maker's schedule. The manager's schedule is for bosses. It's embodied in the traditional appointment book, with each day cut into one hour intervals. You can block off several hours for a single task if you need to, but by default you change what you're doing every hour.\r\n\r\nWhen you use time that way, it's merely a practical problem to meet with someone. Find an open slot in your schedule, book them, and you're done. Most powerful people are on the manager's schedule. It's the schedule of command. But there's another way of using time that's common among people who make things, like programmers and writers. They generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least. You can't write or program well in units of an hour. That's barely enough time to get started.\r\n\r\nWhen you're operating on the maker's schedule, meetings are a disaster. A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in. Plus you have to remember to go to the meeting. That's no problem for someone on the manager's schedule. There's always something coming on the next hour; the only question is what. But when someone on the maker's schedule has a meeting, they have to think about it.\r\n\r\nFor someone on the maker's schedule, having a meeting is like throwing an exception. It doesn't merely cause you to switch from one task to another; it changes the mode in which you work. I find one meeting can sometimes affect a whole day. A meeting commonly blows at least half a day, by breaking up a morning or afternoon. But in addition there's sometimes a cascading effect. If I know the afternoon is going to be broken up, I'm slightly less likely to start something ambitious in the morning.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't be surprised if there start to be more companies like us. I suspect founders may increasingly be able to resist, or at least postpone, turning into managers, just as a few decades ago they started to be able to resist switching from jeans to suits.\r\n",
