So, I was trying to fix my old laptop yesterday, and honestly, it was a nightmare. I thought it would be a simple RAM upgrade, you know, pop the back open, slide the stick in, and boom—faster computer. But no. Nothing is ever that simple for me.

First off, I stripped a screw. Of course I did. I didn't have the right screwdriver size, but I was too lazy to go to the garage to get the kit, so I used a kitchen knife. Bad idea. I spent like twenty minutes trying to twist this tiny screw out with pliers, sweating profusely.

When I finally got it open, the inside was caked in dust. I'm talking years of dust bunnies just living rent-free on my motherboard. I grabbed a can of compressed air and went to town. PRO TIP: Don't hold the can upside down using it. I froze my hand and sprayed liquid all over the fan. I nearly had a heart attack thinking I fried the thing.

Anyway, I eventually got the RAM in, closed it up (minus one screw, RIP), and hit the power button. Black screen. Nothing. My heart sank. I was ready to throw the thing out the window. I sat there for five minutes just staring at my reflection in the black screen, questioning my life choices.

Then I realized I hadn't plugged the battery back in.

Plugged it in. It booted. It flies now. But man, the stress wasn't worth it. Next time I'm just paying someone to do it. Or buying a mac.
